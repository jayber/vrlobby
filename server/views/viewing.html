<p>It just got easier to view VR websites, when Firefox released WebVR as part of its standard distribution:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Download Firefox</a></p>
<p><span class="emph">Make sure you install the 64-bit version of Firefox if you have a 64-bit system.</span></p>
<p>In theory it's as easy as opening the page, clicking on the headset icon and putting your headset on.
    However I have found that sometimes it is necessary to have the Oculus desktop app <i>closed</i> before entering VR.</p><br>

<p>The alternative for the desktop is Chromium experimental builds:</p>

<p>For Gear VR it should be easy: just open the website, click the headset icon and slot your phone into the headset.</p><br>

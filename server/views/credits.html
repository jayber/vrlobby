<br><p>VRLobby is the idea of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-bromley-3617369/">James Bromley</a> and I created the initial website and setup.</p>
<br><p>The technology of VRLobby is currently just an instance of Hayden Lee's <a href="https://github.com/haydenjameslee/networked-aframe">networked-aframe</a> project.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/oOblik">oOblik aka Tim Flaman</a> has made the website respectable.</p>
<p>My thanks to both!</p>
